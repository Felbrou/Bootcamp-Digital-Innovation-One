#### Instructions

1. **To make the crust:** Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix and knead ‚Äì by hand, mixer, or bread machine ‚Äì to form a smooth, elastic dough.
2. Place the dough in a large (at least 5-quart) bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.
3. **To assemble and bake the pizza:** Position a rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 500¬∞F.
4. Add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a [grandma-style pizza pan](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/shop/landing.jsp?go=DetailDefault&id=208526) or an 18‚Äù x 13‚Äù baking sheet and spread it around to coat the pan. Note: it‚Äôs best to use a dark pan for this recipe to achieve pizza with a crispy bottom and edges. Lighter pans will result in a softer crust.
5. Turn the dough out into the pan, gently deflating it as you stretch it to the edges and corners. If the dough starts to shrink back, cover it with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rest for 10 minutes before resuming the stretching.
6. Cover the dough and allow it to rest for 30 minutes until it has puffed slightly.
7. Top the crust with the cheese, spreading it all the way to the edges of the pan then dollop or spread the sauce over the cheese.
8. Bake the pizza in the bottom third of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden.
9. Remove the pizza from the oven and allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving hot.
10. Refrigerate leftover pizza well wrapped; reheat individual slices in a 325¬∞F oven for 5 to 10 minutes.
